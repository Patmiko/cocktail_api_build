<h1>This is my attempt to create an api in AdonisJS</h1>
<p>This repo contains the development files for the api. The DOC.md file contains documentation for the api and the link to a hosted build of that api. End routes and stuff should definitely be changed as it is not intuitive to navigate through. Nonetheless most of the functions are there in place.</p>
