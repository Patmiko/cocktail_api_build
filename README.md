<h1>This is my attempt to create an api in AdonisJS</h1>
<p>This repo contains the development files for the api. The DOC.md file contains documentation for the api and the link to a hosted build of that api. End routes and stuff should definitely be changed as it is not intuitive to navigate through. Nonetheless most of the functions are there in place. File databasedesign.png has an image of representation of database used. Link to docs:</p>
